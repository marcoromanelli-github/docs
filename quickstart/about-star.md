# About Star

## Overview

The Star cluster is a High-Performance Computing (HPC) system at the Science and Innovation Center (SIC) that is designed for a variety of advanced research and computational tasks. It combines NVIDIA HGX-based **compute nodes**, a high-speed all-flash parallel file system-based **storage system**, an ultra-high-throughput/low-latency HDR200Gb/s Infiniband **network fabric**, and a suite of **software applications**. The compute nodes feature high-end H100 and A100 GPUs, AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon processors, and over 7 Terabytes of combined RAM.

The cluster runs SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management), a job scheduler and queueing system that efficiently allocates the cluster's resources to manage competing resource demands.

Users run many different applications on the cluster based on their needs, such as Python projects via Jupyter Notebooks, OpenMPI-based parallel jobs, NetCDF (often used to manage large datasets in climatology, meteorology, oceanography, and GIS applications). Programs are run directly on the hardware (bare-metal) to maximize performance and minimize overhead.

Containerization is also increasingly popular in HPC it provides isolated environments that allow for the reuse of images for better reproducibility and software portability without the performance impact of other methods or the hastle of manualy installing dependencies. Containers are run using Apptainer (formerly Singularity), a containerization platform similar to Docker with the major difference that it runs under user privileges instead of `root`. Users can deploy images from NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud), which provides access to a wide array of pre-built images with GPU-optimized software for diverse applications. Leveraging container images can save a lot of time as users don’t need to set up the software applications from scratch and can just pull and use the NGC images with Apptainer.

### Storage System

Our storage system contains of four HPE PFSS nodes, collectively offering a total of 63TB of storage. You can think of these four nodes as one unified 63TB storage unit as it is a **Parallel File System Storage** component. These nodes work in parallel and are all mounted under **one** mount point on the gpu nodes only (`/fs1`).

## Our vision

Making complex and time-intensive calculations simple and accessible.

### Our Goal

Our heart is set on creating a community where our cluster is a symbol of collaboration and discovery. We are wishing to provide a supportive space where researchers and students can express their scientific ideas and explore unchanted areas. We aim to make the complicated world of computational research a shared path of growth, learning, and significant discoveries for the ones that are eager to learn.
